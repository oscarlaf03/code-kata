# San Francisco Restaurant Recommendations

# A CSV file contains a list of restaurants in San Francisco with their latitudes and longitudes, 
# ratings (on a scale of 1 to 5) and their time-slots of operation. 
# A restaurant can serve breakfast (8 am - 11 am), lunch (12 pm - 3 pm), or dinner (6:30 pm to 9:30 pm). 
# For someone visiting San Francisco, you need to recommend the top three restaurants nearest to the visitor’s current location
#  (in a 1-mile radius) for the current time-slot, based on restaurant ratings. 
# The visitor’s current location (latitude and longitude), and time of the day (24-hour format) will be given as inputs.
